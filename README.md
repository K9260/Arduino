# Arduino
fastled_music.h
and
music_controlled_led.ino are very simple music reactive programs for your WS2812 LED strip and arduino.
<br>
They were not planned to be shared but few people asked for them so here they are.
<br>
So <strong>please understand</strong> they are nothing very fancy nor well commented.
<br>
<br>
VU-meter is the newest and working well with different strip lenghts
<br>
<br>
You will need a microphone to your arduino board - I used one called "MX 4466".
You can get one from ebay.
